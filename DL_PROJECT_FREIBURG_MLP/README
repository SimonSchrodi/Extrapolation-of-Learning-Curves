1. each model has a model_*.txt file that contains model config details and other statistics

2. The loss for 100 epochs for each model are plotted, the values can be found in the above file

3. Model is tested with 500 test samples and the absolute error is plotted, values can be found in the model file

4. Signed error values can also be found for each test sample.

5. Mean error of each model is plotted for 5 models.

6. MSE error is also plotted, but there is a mistake, multiply 100
